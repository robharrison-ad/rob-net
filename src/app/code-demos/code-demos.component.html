      <P>
        Please bear with me while I piece together some work samples. The majority of my career has been developing
        applications that live behind a corporate firewall; and the ones that don't live there are online banking
        applications that are accessible only by those with accounts.
      </P>
      <P>
        I've spent some time going through work samples that I do have around and put some of them together here. In
        addition, whilie I was working for the credit union, one of my projects was to build an application for
        customers of their Cash Rewards credit card, and I happen to be one of those customers. So, I put together a
        little demo of that application. Heck, I've even started putting stuff back together from memory! There's more
        to come, but for now please have a look at what's here.

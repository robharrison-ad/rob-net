            <p>Hi!</p>

            <p>My name is Rob Harrison and I am an Application Developer with extensive experience developing multi-tiered, database-driven applications. I have <span class="accented">over ten years of experience developing highly customized applications</span> used to run various business systems and processes within Intel Corporation. In this role, I assisted with requirements gathering and built applications from concept to deployment, and then supported many of them throughout their lifespans. I left Intel in 2016 and went on to work for a regional financial institution developing and maintaining custom online banking software. After that I spent some time back at Intel on a six-month contract to develop an application for use by their Information Security group.</p>


            <p>Currently I’d say my strongest passion for development lies with the various <span class="accented italic">JavaScript/HTML5</span>-based frameworks that have come out in the last five-or-so years, particularly <span class="accented high italic">Angular</span> (all versions) and, to a lesser degree, <span class="accented bold italic">ReactJS</span>. Client-side programming has always been so much fun to me because of its speedy responsiveness to user interaction. <img align="right" src="../../assets/images/valley-girl-postback.gif"   class="valley-girl-image" /> But, historically, it has been quite labor-intensive. (Basically, you could do anything, but you had to write a lot of code to accomplish it!) But with frameworks like these, much of the “under the hood” work is done already, so developers are able to devote much more time to building a <span class="accented">slick, user-friendly application</span> without tons of overhead. (And when I mention overhead, I’m looking at you, Silverlight!) Of course, before those frameworks came along, I developed nearly everything in <span class="accented italic">ASP.NET</span> using <span class="accented italic">C#</span> and <span class="accented italic">Visual Basic</span>. Even still I use ASP.NET/C# for most of my data layers and business logic layers.  And speaking of data layers, I seem to have developoed a strange fondness for writing <span class="accented italic">SQL</span> scripts (the more complex and chellenging, the better!), which, of course, is very benefecial in this area.

            </p>


            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-xs-12">
                <p>I love learning <span class="accented">new technologies</span>, especially ones that enable me to create <span class="accented">super cool apps</span>! But I don’t adopt and use a new technology for a project just because “everyone’s going to it.” I’m all about     using     the right tool for the job -- whatever is going to give the customer the features they want and need     in     the time allotted for development. My feelings here also stem from having inherited too many apps from     developers who went crazy with some abstract new framework or methodology, just to do it, which made     for     supportability and maintainability nightmares! On top of that, I’ve watched a few too many development     teams who walked the bleeding edge simply because that’s what their friends were doing, only to     discover     half way through a project that they had bitten off way more than they could chew and over-engineered     themselves into a mess. (But, hey, at least you can say you were one of the to use it,     right? Oh, and one of the last, too.)</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>Through all of these years writing code, I’ve worked closely with <span classs="accented high">User Experience (UX)</span> engineers and I’ve learned a lot from them. When I’m designing my application or writing my code, it’s always with my mind on creating an <span class="accented">intuitive, informative interface that will make users’ lives easier</span> while they’re doing their job using the tool I’ve built. After all, people have to use these tools every day, sometimes for the majority of their day.  The tools I build for them should not just facilitate their work processes, but should provide an <span class="accented">enhanced and more efficient</span> work process.
            </p>

            <p>And that (creating applications that blow away users’ expectations) is the second of at least two ways I derive pleasure from what I do. The first, as I used to think of it when I was a kid and teaching myself various coding languages, is the fun I get from “making the computer do whatever I want.” You know, the nerdy pleasure that comes from thinking of something you want or need a program to do, and making it happen. Inevitably during those learning years, some adult, like a parent or a teacher, would make a joke like, <img align="left"   src="../../assets/images/thumbsup-mitchell.v3.png" class="thumbs-up-image" /> “What’s next? Is it going to make my breakfast toast, too?” My immediate thought would be along the lines of “I’m sure there’s a way to make that happen, want me to do it?!” Since then... since I began writing code for a living rather than just for my own amusement, I’ve discovered all the ways in which it makes people’s lives easier and more productive. So I guess that’s cool, too!</p>
